This repository is forked from XRT, and expanded some functions.

Package xrt (XRayTracer) is a python software library for ray tracing and wave
propagation in x-ray regime. It is primarily meant for modeling synchrotron
sources, beamlines and beamline elements. Includes a GUI for creating a
beamline and interactively viewing it in 3D.
